    <property name="Flavour" value="Yo ho! A pirate's life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there's more to a pirate's life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what's fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate's Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain's orders, every captain has to answer to the council.&#10;Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that's not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there's power, there's intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You'll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you'll attract a host of powerful enemies.&#10;If you can't earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won't ask questions. They've got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.&#10;According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can't buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there's chum in the water, you'll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you're eager to earn her patronage, then you'd best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders."/>

Yesterday, you were serenely sailing to a port in Rahadoum, but in the middle of the night, your ship's crew successfully mutinied against their captain. The merchantman vessel you hired has headed south, and the mutineers have made plans that are significantly different from yours. The ship's new captain, Jemma Redclaw, is willing to let you disembark at the next port with most of your coin. Unfortunately, they've set sail for profit and plunder in the seas of the Shackles.&#10;Redclaw watched as dockhands loaded precious cargo. She waited as conspirators recruited former pirates. And she never expected the captain to take on passengers, but every plan has a few complications. Jemma Redclaw was hired for her skills as a navigator, but in the middle of the night, she reclaimed a job she walked away from years ago: the captain of a pirate vessel.&#10;Now that the old captain's body has been tossed overboard, the crew has revealed their true colors. Captain Redclaw poisoned her conspirators' minds with promises. If you're careful, you could share in their good fortune... or turn on the traitors who claimed this ship.&#10;First, you'll need to survive the voyage. The seas ahead are fraught with danger, from supernatural spirits and sea monsters to rival crews of buccaneers. You can wait for an opportunity to rebel against the mutinous scoundrels who live on this leaky tub, but if you can't survive in the Shackles, you'll never get a chance to regain your freedom. There's rough seas ahead, lads and lasses, so you'd best keep a weather eye on the horizon."/>

If this is a vision of your future, you have no memory of why you're being pursued by scalawags and cutthroats. They're relentless! They'll chase you round the Abendego maelstrom and through Abyssal flames before they give up! As you bark out orders, the crew rushes to carry out your plans. You'll have to outrun these enemy ships, because if you hesitate for a moment, the bloodthirsty pirates are going to get closer. You can already see the wreckage of other vessels that weren't as swift as your Shackles pirate ship.&#10;Eventually, this nightmare will come to an end, but before it does, you may learn a thing or two about the life of a pirate.

    <property name="Flavour" value="The Pirate's Council has almost thirty councilors, and they've been hearing tales of your exploits. You've already earned the patronage of a wealthy dowager: the lovely Lady Smithee, recently betrothed to a handsome scoundrel named Heartbreak Hinsin. Impressing some pirate lords next would be a savvy idead, especially if you've got designs on becoming one of them. There's plenty o' ways to do that, but there's one that everyone knows best: winning the Free Captain's Regatta. The sailor who wins it is the next lucky soul to join the council.&#10;Some pirates seek plunder or infamy, but there's no shortage of ambitious souls who train all year for that one race. Know this: The cronies of the Pirate's Council love to sponsor races. And wealthy aristocrats who've just been wed love to host lavish festivals and parties. It just so happens that Lady Smithee and her husband, Hinsin, are doing both: they're hosting a regatta to celebrate their nuptuals. The winner stands to gain some plunder: a pile o' dubloons and a swift ship.&#10;Most of the competition is the usual rifraff, but you do have one formidable competitor. His name is Gortus Svard. The few who've sailed against him and lived say he'll do anything to win. If he can't take the prize, he'll surely take your lives. Now here's your chance to show the council what a true crew of pirates can do. Gortus Svard's loss could be your gain. Let the race begin!"/>

You've all won! You sing or swim together, like true mates. And best of all, the Pirate's Council saw it all... if they were sober at the party that is.
