    <property name="Flavour" value="Yo ho! A pirate's life at last! You and your crew can now enjoy the freedom of sailing through the Shackles... but there's more to a pirate's life than rum and gunpowder. Even pirates have a code of what's fair and foul, and in the Shackles, the Pirate's Council enforces it. Just as every shipmate has to follow a captain's orders, every captain has to answer to the council.&#10;Earning a seat on that council could open all sorts of opportunities for you, but that's not an easy feat. For a start, wherever there's power, there's intrigue. The most powerful captains are continually maneuvering for position, like a flotilla of ships on the eve of a great battle. You'll need to set your course carefully: each time you gain a powerful ally, you'll attract a host of powerful enemies.&#10;If you can't earn the patronage of a pirate lord, the Shackles has other wealthy patrons willing to hire a crew that won't ask questions. They've got cargo to deliver, rivals to punish, ports to defend, and all manner of monsters set against them. The most ruthless pirates answer to no one, save for their own whims and ambitions. Yet if you ever need to take arms against a sea of troubles, it never hurts to have a few more captains in your fleet.&#10;According to the scuttlebutt around yer last port of call, a wealthy patron is spending a lot of coin. Agasta Smithee is a widow who inherited everything from Bertram Smithee, the former captain of the Vale. The heartbroken say money can't buy happiness, but she has enough money to ignore them. Just as a shoal of sharks will circle yer ship when there's chum in the water, you'll have no shortage of competition once Lady Smithee starts spreading her wealth around. If you're eager to earn her patronage, then you'd best be ready: close ranks and prepare to repel boarders."/>

    <property name="Flavour" value="Your ocean voyage has taken a turn for the worse. Yesterday, you were serenely sailing to a port in Rahadoum, but in the middle of the night, your ship's crew successfully mutinied against their captain. The merchantman vessel you hired has headed south, and the mutineers have made plans that are significantly different from yours. The ship's new captain, Jemma Redclaw, is willing to let you disembark at the next port with most of your coin. Unfortunately, they've set sail for profit and plunder in the seas of the Shackles.&#10;Redclaw watched as dockhands loaded precious cargo. She waited as conspirators recruited former pirates. And she never expected the captain to take on passengers, but every plan has a few complications. Jemma Redclaw was hired for her skills as a navigator, but in the middle of the night, she reclaimed a job she walked away from years ago: the captain of a pirate vessel.&#10;Now that the old captain's body has been tossed overboard, the crew has revealed their true colors. Captain Redclaw poisoned her conspirators' minds with promises. If you're careful, you could share in their good fortune... or turn on the traitors who claimed this ship.&#10;First, you'll need to survive the voyage. The seas ahead are fraught with danger, from supernatural spirits and sea monsters to rival crews of buccaneers. You can wait for an opportunity to rebel against the mutinous scoundrels who live on this leaky tub, but if you can't survive in the Shackles, you'll never get a chance to regain your freedom. There's rough seas ahead, lads and lasses, so you'd best keep a weather eye on the horizon."/>

The gentle rocking motion of the waves beneath your ship eases your hammock back and forth as you drift into a deep slumber. You should be dreaming of better days, but instead, something has disturbed your rest. You're not sure whether it's the grog you had with your dinner or the cook's unidentifiable slop, but you're experiencing a vision of a very different life, one where you're continually traveling across the ocean. As you squirm in your hammock, you dream of a restless life on the high seas.&#10;Cannonades thunder across the bow of your vessel, and you open your eyes to find yourself on the deck of a pirate ship! If this is a vision of your future, you have no memory of why you're being pursued by scalawags and cutthroats. They're relentless! They'll chase you round the Abendego maelstrom and through Abyssal flames before they give up! As you bark out orders, the crew rushes to carry out your plans. You'll have to outrun these enemy ships, because if you hesitate for a moment, the bloodthirsty pirates are going to get closer. You can already see the wreckage of other vessels that weren't as swift as your Shackles pirate ship.&#10;Eventually, this nightmare will come to an end, but before it does, you may learn a thing or two about the life of a pirate. Of course, you're a respectable adventurer. You'd never take up a life of piracy. Would you? Any sailor worth her salt will tell you that you can never be sure what lies on the horizon."/>

Now your fortunes have turned: you're not only free to disembark here, but you have the chance to recruit your own crew and set sail on your own ship!&#10;Your life could be smooth sailing, but only if you can leave your past behind you. The captain of your former ship doesn't like competition. Rumors have been spreading of a treasure hidden on this island, and no doubt she wants to make sure that rumor doesn't spread. The captain might think you're out to steal her crew, her ship, or worse, the reason she sailed back to the Shackles: her plunder. Of course, it's entirely possible that other buccaneers have heard the rumor and started searching as well. Redclaw isn't the only pirate in Drenchport... so gather a crew and set sail before you draw too much attention to yourself."/>

He's earned his share of infamy defeating those who challenge him, but he lacks the wealth and influence a truly terrifying pirate requires. Maybe that's why he's courting Agasta Smithee, the extremely influential Lady of Tidewater Rock. She's been a widow for too long, but the tide is turning.&#10;Now that tales of Lady Smithee's amorous ambitions have spread through every inn, tavern, brothel, and galley for miles around, she's suddenly attracted an entourage of suitors. Apparently, the wealthy dowager just gets more beautiful as she gets older, or perhaps, those who have pitied the widow are now seeing her in a new light. Whatever the truth may be, Hinsin's got a lot of competition lined up. You'll have to fight through a crowd of admirers to get anywhere near his lady love. And then there's Master Scourge. He hated her last husband, so he wants her to die alone and unloved.&#10;Cynical sailors claim that Hinsin has docked his ship in Lady Smithee's port because he really wants Tidewater Rock, but those of a more romantic inclination say that he's in love--really and truly smitten with Smithee. Bards have started writing bawdy ballads.&#10;Maybe if you could help bring these two lovebirds together, you could share in their joy and happiness... and maybe they'd make for fine allies in your times of trouble.

Out of gratitude, she's willing to hire you for the occasionall cargo run and perhaps a bit of skullduggery.&#10;Here's the latest haul: An isolated island is in need of supplies--medicine, gunpowder, and of course, more rum--but your mission of mercy has one complication: your port of call has been overrun with a gaggle of grim and ghastly grindylows.&#10;I'll be honest, lads and lasses. Yer ship isn't up to the task. For this mission, you'll need to work with a crew of specialists. Lady Smithee has friends in low places, including an infamous raider known for his stalwart ship, his reckless crew, and his infrequent bouts of kleptomania. He's traded his weidling for a swifter ship, and the sailors aborad her are all goblins. You heart that right! Goblins! Nasty, sneaking, treacherous little goblins. If there's anyone who can deal with grindylows, it's goblins.&#10;Your wealthy patron has intimated that if some of those goblins were to become... expendable, shall we say... she wouldn't shed a tear, as long as that cargo gets delivered. So there ya go: The ransacking goblin has a ship, and you've got a mission. It's time to set sail for your next destination. Damn the grindylows! Fully speed ahead!"/>

In fact, some have a bit more greed than common sense.&#10;One full moon, sea devils set out to seize this poor matriarch.&#10;They stole her spawn. They off-loaded her offspring. They trapped her, they tormented her, and... hold on to yer grog... they broke both her legs! Aye! Her flipper-finned legs! With the help of some passing sailors who actually had a conscience, the matriarch escaped, but she's mad and she's mangled and she wants her revenge.&#10;Mayhaps yer the salty dogs that can help her. Track down the sea devils who forced her to that fate, and you'll have the everlasting gratitude of the fishfolk matriarch. And take care: Krelloort is the worst of the sea devil lot.
